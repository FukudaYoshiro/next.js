# Example app with React Testing Library and Jest

This example features an app with [react testing library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) by [Kent Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds/). This library encourages your applications to be more accessible and allows you to get your tests closer to using your components the way a user will, which allows your tests to give you more confidence that your application will work when a real user uses it. And also, is a replacement for enzyme.
