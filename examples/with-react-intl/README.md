## The idea behind the example

This example app shows how to integrate [React Intl][] with Next.

### Features of this example app

- Server-side language negotiation
- React Intl locale data loading via `pages/_document.js` customization
- React Intl integration with [custom App](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#custom-app) component
- `<IntlProvider>` creation with `locale`, `messages`, and `initialNow` props
- Default message extraction via `babel-plugin-react-intl` integration
- Translation management via build script and customized Next server
- withIntl HOC for pages because injectIntl do not hoist static methods.

### Translation Management

This app stores translations and default strings in the `lang/` dir. This dir has `.messages/` subdir which is where React Intl's Babel plugin outputs the default messages it extracts from the source code. The default messages (`en.json` in this example app) is also generated by the build script. This file can then be sent to a translation service to perform localization for the other locales the app should support.

The translated messages files that exist at `lang/*.json` are only used during production, and are automatically provided to the `<IntlProvider>`. During development the `defaultMessage`s defined in the source code are used. To prepare the example app for localization and production run the build script and start the server in production mode:

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

You can then switch your browser's language preferences to French and refresh the page to see the UI update accordingly.
