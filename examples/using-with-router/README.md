# Example app utilizing `withRouter` utility for routing

## How to use

### Using `create-next-app`

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app) with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) or [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx#readme) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example using-with-router using-with-router-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example using-with-router using-with-router-app
```

### Download manually

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/zeit/next.js):

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/zeit/next.js/tar.gz/canary | tar -xz --strip=2 next.js-canary/examples/using-with-router
cd using-with-router
```

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [now](https://zeit.co/now) ([download](https://zeit.co/download))

```bash

```

## The idea behind the example

Sometimes, we want to use the `router` inside component of our app without using the singleton `next/router` API. 

You can do that by creating a React Higher Order Component with the help of the `withRouter` utility.
