# Recoil Example

This example shows how to integrate Recoil in Next.js.

[Recoil](https://recoiljs.org) is an experimental set of utilities for state management with React used by some teams at Facebook. This example takes the code from the redux examples and demonstrates how it would be implemented with Recoil.
