# Example: Firebase authentication with a serverless API

## How to use

### Using `create-next-app`

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) or [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx#readme) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-firebase-authentication-serverless with-firebase-authentication-serverless-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-firebase-authentication-serverless with-firebase-authentication-serverless-app
```

### Download manually

Download the example:

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/zeit/next.js/tar.gz/canary | tar -xz --strip=2 next.js-canary/examples/with-firebase-authentication-serverless
cd with-firebase-authentication-serverless
```

Set up Firebase:

- Create a project at the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Get your account credentials from the Firebase console at _Project settings > Service accounts_, where you can click on _Generate new private key_ and download the credentials as a json file. It will contain keys such as `project_id`, `client_email` and `client_id`. Set them as environment variables in the `.env` file at the root of this project.
- Get your authentication credentials from the Firebase console under _Project settings > General> Your apps_ Add a new web app if you don't already have one. Under _Firebase SDK snippet_ choose _Config_ to get the configuration as JSON. It will include keys like `apiKey`, `authDomain` and `databaseUrl`. Set the appropriate environment variables in the `.env` file at the root of this project.
- Set the environment variables `SESSION_SECRET_CURRENT` and `SESSION_SECRET_PREVIOUS` in the `.env` file. (These are used by [`cookie-session`](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session/#secret).]

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/new?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

After deploying, copy the deployment URL and navigate to your Firebase project's Authentication tab. Scroll down in the page to "Authorized domains" and add that URL to the list.

## The idea behind the example

This example includes Firebase authentication and serverless [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). On login, the app calls `/api/login`, which stores the user's info (their decoded Firebase token) in a cookie so that it's available server-side in `getInitialProps`. On logout, the app calls `/api/logout` to destroy the cookie.
