# with Firebase Hosting example

The goal is to host the Next.js app on Firebase Cloud Functions with Firebase Hosting rewrite rules so our app is served from our Firebase Hosting URL. Each individual `page` bundle is served in a new call to the Cloud Function which performs the initial server render.

<summary><b>Make sure that firebase is set up and you have the projectID</b></summary>

- Install Firebase Tools: `npm i -g firebase-tools`
- Create a project through the [firebase web console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Login to the Firebase CLI tool with `firebase login`
- Grab the **projectID** from [`firebase projects:list`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#admin-commands) or the web consoles URL: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/<projectID>`

## How to use

### Using `create-next-app`

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npm init next-app --example with-firebase-hosting with-firebase-hosting-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-firebase-hosting with-firebase-hosting-app
```

Update `.firebaserc`: adding your firebase project ID

### Download manually

Download the example:

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/vercel/next.js/tar.gz/canary | tar -xz --strip=2 next.js-canary/examples/with-firebase-hosting
cd with-firebase-hosting
```

Update `.firebaserc`: adding your firebase project ID

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev

# to run Firebase locally for testing:
npm run serve

# to deploy it to the cloud with Firebase:
npm run deploy
```

## Typescript

To use Typescript, simply follow [Typescript setup](https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/typescript/setup) as normal (package.json scripts are already set).

i.e: `npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node`

Then you can create components and pages in `.tsx` or `.ts`

**Only `src/next.config.js` and `firebaseFunctions.js` must remain in `*.js` format.**

## Good to know

- [`firebase.json`](firebase.json:#L7) outlines the catchall rewrite rule for our Cloud Function.
- The empty `public/.gitignore` file is to ensure `public/` dir exists as it is required for Firebase Hosting. It is [configured](firebase.json:#L4) (by [default](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#ignore)) that dotfiles (`public/.*`) are ignored from bein publicly served.
- The Cloud Function is named `nextjsFunc` (changeable in [firebaseFunctions.js](firebaseFunctions.js#L16) and [firebase.json](firebase.json#L8)).
- `public/*` files are statically served through [Firebase hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#public), not through [NextJs server](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving).
- Specifying [`"engines": {"node": "10"}`](package.json#L5-L7) in `package.json` is required and the [latest supported](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/manage-functions#set_nodejs_version) by firebase functions.

#### Customization

Next App is in `src/` directory.

The crucial files for the setup:

- `.firebaserc`
- `firebase.json`
- `firebaseFunctions.js`
- `src/next.config.js`
- In `package.json`: `firebase-*` packages and `engines` field

## Caveat

Because firebase functions require `"engines": {"node": "10"}` (or 8) to be specified (in `package.json`), if you are using `yarn` (instead of `npm`), you will need to add flag [`--ignore-engines`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install/#toc-yarn-install-ignore-engines).
