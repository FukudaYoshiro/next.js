Welcome to your new blog built with Next.js.

You&rsquo;ll find this post in your `page/posts` directory. To add new posts, add a MDX file in the `page/posts` directory, press `ctrl + c` to stop the development server and run `now dev` again.

After you personalize your blog you can deploy it to Now.

```bash
$ now
```

Then, you will see your blog online in a URL like https://nextjs-blog-starter.now.sh
