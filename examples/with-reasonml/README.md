## The idea behind the example

This example features:

* An app that mixes together JavaScript and ReasonML components and functions
* An app with two pages which has a common Counter component
* That Counter component maintain the counter inside its module. This is used primarily to illustrate that modules get initialized once and their state variables persist in runtime
