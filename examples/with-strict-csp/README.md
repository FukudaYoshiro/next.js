# Example app with strict CSP generating script hash

This example features how you can set up a strict CSP for your pages including Next.js' inline bootstrap script by hash.
It defines the CSP by document `meta` tag.

Note: There are still valid cases for using a nonce in case you need to inline scripts or styles for which calculating a hash is not feasible.
