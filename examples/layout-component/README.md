## The idea behind the example

This example shows a very common use case when building websites where you need to repeat some sort of layout for all your pages. Our pages are: `home`, `about` and `contact` and they all share the same `<head>` settings, the `<nav>` and the `<footer>`. Further more, the title (and potentially other head elements) can be sent as a prop to the layout component so that it's customizable in all pages.
