# Next.js example with [`graphql-react`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-react)

[`graphql-react`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-react) is a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) client for [React](https://reactjs.org) using modern [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context) and [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro) APIs that is lightweight (&lt; 2.5 KB [size limited](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)) but powerful; the first [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay) and [Apollo](https://apollographql.com/docs/react) alternative with server side rendering.

# or
yarn create next-app --example with-graphql-react with-graphql-react-app
```

### Download manually

## Notes

- In `next.config.js` Next.js config is decorated using [`withGraphQLConfig`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/next-graphql-react#function-withgraphqlconfig) from [`next-graphql-react`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/next-graphql-react), to exclude specific [`graphql-react`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-react) and [`next-graphql-react`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/next-graphql-react) server only imports from the client bundle.
- In `pages/_app.js` a [custom `App` component](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#custom-app) is decorated with the [`withGraphQLApp`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/next-graphql-react/#function-withgraphqlapp) [higher-order component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components) from [`next-graphql-react`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/next-graphql-react), generating a `graphql` prop that populates the [`GraphQLProvider`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-react#function-graphqlprovider) component from [`graphql-react`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-react).
- In `pages/index.js` the [`useGraphQL`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-react#function-usegraphql) React hook from [`graphql-react`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-react) is used to query the [GraphQL Pok√©mon API](https://github.com/lucasbento/graphql-pokemon) and show a picture of Pikachu.
