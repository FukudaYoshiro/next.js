## The idea behind the example

This example show how to use [Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) to wrap page components using High Order Components and use `getInitialProps` without worries.

It also configure Babel to change our recompose imports so we're going to actually import only the functions we need and reduce the bundle size.
