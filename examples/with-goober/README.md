# Example with goober

This is an example of how [ðŸ¥œ goober](https://github.com/cristianbote/goober) can be used with `Next.js` to fully render a SSR website or app. [ðŸ¥œ goober](https://github.com/cristianbote/goober) proposal is: "a less than 1KB css-in-js alternative with a familiar API" and offering the same functionality one would need.

Why is there a peanut emoji?

Goober initially started with a slogan as "a less than 1KB css-in-js library at the cost of _peanuts_". Goober also means a kind of peanut so, it fits!
