# Build Target

Next.js supports various build targets, each changing the way your application is built and run. We'll explain each of the targets below.

## `server` target

> This is the default target, however, we highly recommend the [`serverless` target](#serverless-target). The `serverless` target enforces [additional constraints](https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review#serverless-upgrades-itself) to keep you in the [Pit of Success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/).

This target is compatible with both `next start` and [custom server](/docs/advanced-features/custom-server.md) setups (it's mandatory for a custom server).

Your application will be built and deployed as a monolith. This is the default target and no action is required on your part to opt-in.

## `serverless` target

> Deployments to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) will automatically enable this target. You should not opt-into it yourself.

This target will output independent pages that don't require a monolithic server.

It's only compatible with `next start` or Serverless deployment platforms (like [Vercel](https://vercel.com)) â€” you cannot use the custom server API.

To opt-into this target, set the following configuration in your `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless',
}
```
